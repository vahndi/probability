    The exponential distribution is the probability distribution of the time
    between events in a Poisson point process, i.e., a process in which events
    occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate.
    It is a particular case of the gamma distribution.
    It is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution,
    and it has the key property of being memory-less.
