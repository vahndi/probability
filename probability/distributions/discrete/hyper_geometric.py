    The hyper-geometric distribution is a discrete probability distribution that
    describes the probability of k successes (random draws for which the object
    drawn has a specified feature) in n draws, without replacement, from a
    finite population of size N that contains exactly K objects with that
    feature, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure.
    In contrast, the binomial distribution describes the probability of k
    successes in n draws with replacement.
